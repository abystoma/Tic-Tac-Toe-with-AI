## How to play
A promt will apear before you i.e. ``input: `` , Then you have to put your commands. <br> Use the ``start`` command to play or ``exit`` to stop right away. [*Note that you can't quit once the game starts*]. <br> Start your game by choosing the *flags* and Here are some examples: <br>

``start user user``
``start user medium``
``start medium user``
``start easy medium``

Here *user* is the player(HUMAN) and *easy/medium/hard* are the AI and it's dificulty levels. <br> If you want to play with another player(HUMAN) i.e **Player Vs Player** you choose ``start user user``. Very intuiative huh? <br> After that the you will be prompted to choose the coordinates i.e. the place where you want to put your **0** or **X**. The Coordinate system will be detailed below.
